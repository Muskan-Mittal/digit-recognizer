# digit-recognizer

This repository contains Convolational Neural Network Model for Handwritten text recognition.
The model was initally trained using dataset from Kaggle. An accuracy of 98.84% is obtained.
Further the data was increased using data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and help the model to generalise well. Generators were used to handle this large amount of data. The accuracy improved to 99.1%.
